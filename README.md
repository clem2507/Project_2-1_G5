# Project_2-1_G5 - Coding an Abalone Game-Playing Agent 

--> How to run the game?

First, download the zip project file.

Then, there are two different ways of compiling it:

1) 
    - Import the project into your prefered java IDEA
    - Make sure to use a supported SDK that contains javaFX library (for example java 10)
    - Go into the UI package located inside the main Abalone folder
    - Run the HomePage.java class
    
2)
    - Open your terminal 
    - Go to the Abalone folder (cd <path to Abalon>) and use the following commands: 
  
      gradle build
      gradle run

From there, the code should run and you may play by pressing start! The rules are in the rule window, you can access them by clicking the "rule" button.

Enjoy, 

Group 5.
