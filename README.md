# Project_2-1_G5 - Coding an Abalone Game-Playing Agent 

--> How to run the game?


First, download the zip project file.


Then, there are two different ways of compiling it:


1)
    - Open your terminal 
    - Go to the Abalon folder (cd) and use the following commands: 
  
            gradle build
  
            gradle run

2) 
    - Import the project into your prefered java IDEA
    - Make sure to use a supported SDK that contains javaFX library (for example java 10)
    - Go into the UI package located inside the main Abalon folder
    - Run the HomePage.java class
    
   
From there, the code should run and you may play by pressing start! The rules are in the rule window, you can access them by clicking the "rule" button.

Enjoy, 

Group 5.
