How to run the game?

Open the terminal. Go to the Abalon folder (cd <path to Abalon>) and use the following commands: 

  gradle build
  gradle run
  
From there, the code should run and you may play by pressing start! The rules are in the rule window, you can access them by clicking the "rule" button.

Enjoy, 

Group 5.
